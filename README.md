#Style Finder: Computer Vision-Based Fashion Analysis


## Overview

This lab walks you through building a complete multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for fashion analysis. You'll learn how to combine computer vision, vector similarity search, and large language models using the Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct model to perform detailed, catalog-style fashion analysis from images.

By the end, you'll deploy your pipeline as an interactive web app using Gradio, allowing users to upload images and receive AI-generated fashion insights in real time.

## Learning objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Implement a complete multimodal RAG pipeline integrating computer vision with structured fashion datasets
Use image encoding techniques for vector-based similarity matching and retrieval
Explain how to enhance LLM responses by augmenting them with retrieved contextual information
Develop a user-friendly interface with Gradio
Apply modular programming principles to create maintainable AI applications
Gain practical experience with state-of-the-art multimodal AI techniques
